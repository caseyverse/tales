<p>&quot;My dear fellow,&quot; said Basil Turner as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, &quot;life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of the window hand in hand, over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the lustrous things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the planning, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most unusual results, it would make all fiction with the real world. The only thing we could do was to keep our eyes fixed on the stars, and to think of the things which are not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And yet I am not convinced of it,&quot; I answered. &quot;The cases which come to light on the daily feeds are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar too. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be, neither fascinating nor artistic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A certain selection and discretion must used in producing a realistic effect, remarked Turner. &quot;This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital of essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.&quot;</p>
<p>I smiled and shoock my head. &quot;I can quite understand your thinking,&quot; I said. &quot;Of course, in your postion of unoffical adviser and helper to everybody who is puzzled, throughout three coninents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here&quot; - I displayed the homepage from Pawprint Press onto my tablet for a practical test - &quot;let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife.&quot; There is half of a column of text, but I know without reading it that is is all perfectly familar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, push, blow and bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more curde.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,&quot; said Turner, taking the tablet and glancing his eye down it. &quot;This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in cleaning up some points in connection with it. The husband was abstinent, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his dentures and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.&quot;</p>
<p>He held out his snuffbox of an old gold, with a great amethyst in the center of the lid. Its splendor was in such contract to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, said he, &quot;I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the Atlas Base on Strion 5 in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler documents.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the ring?&quot; I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.</p>
<p>&quot;It was from the reigning family of Bayside Point, though the matter in which I served them was such delicacy that I can't confide it even to you, who have been good to chronicle one or two of my little problems.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And have you any on hand just now.&quot; I asked out of interest.</p>
<p>&quot;Some ten or twelve, but none of which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is unimportant matters that there is a field for observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes apt to be simpler, for the bigger the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive.&quot;</p>
<p>He had risen from his chair and was standing between the blind gazing down at the dull neutral-tinted Furtropolis street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boe around her neck, and a large red curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at over the windows, while her body oscillated background and forward, and her fingers fidget with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as the swimmer who leave the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the door chime.</p>
<p>&quot;I have seen those symptoms before, said Turner.</p>
